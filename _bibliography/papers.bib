abstract = {It is customary to design a control system in such a way that, whatever the chosen control satisfying the constraints, the system does not enter so-called unsafe regions. This work introduces a general computer-assisted methodology to prove that a given linear control system with compact constraints avoids a chosen unsafe set at a chosen final time \(T\). Relying on support hyperplanes, we devise a functional such that the property of interest is equivalent to finding a point at which the functional is negative. Actually evaluating the functional first requires time discretization. We thus provide explicit, fine discretization estimates for various types of matrices underlying the control problem. Second, computations lead to roundoff errors, which are dealt with by means of interval arithmetic. The control of both error types then leads to rigorous, computer-assisted proofs of nonreachability of the unsafe set. We illustrate the applicability and flexibility of our method in different contexts featuring various control constraints, unsafe sets, types of matrices, and problem dimensions. },

  abstract = Analysing reachability associated to a control system is a subtle issue, especially for infinite-dimensional dynamics, and when controls are subject to bounded constraints. We develop a computer-assisted framework for establishing non-reachability in linear parabolic PDEs governed by strongly elliptic operators, extending recent finite-dimensional techniques introduced in [Has+2025] to the PDE setting. The non-reachability of a given target is shown to be equivalent to proving that a properly defined dual functional takes negative values. Our approach combines rigorous numerics with explicit convergence estimates for discretisations of the adjoint equation, ensuring mathematically certified results with tight error bounds. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our framework on Laplacian-driven control systems, showcasing its accuracy and reliability under various types of control constraints.
