  author={Eloi Tanguy and Julie Delon and Rémi Flamary},
  abstract={We generalise Wasserstein Barycentres, allowing the computation of barycentres between measures in different spaces. We provide efficient solvers for this new problem, and study a particular case which corresponds to a reconstruction problem. Studying the properties of this problem, we draw partial conclusions on the optima of the discrete Sliced Wasserstein Distance.},

      author={Eloi Tanguy and Rémi Flamary and Julie Delon},
      abstract={This paper deals with the reconstruction of a discrete measure \(\gamma_Z\ \) on \(R^d\) from the knowledge of its pushforward measures \(P_i\)#\(\gamma_Z\) linear applications \(P_i: R^d \rightarrow R^{h}\) (for instance projections onto subspaces). The measure \(\gamma_Z\ \) being fixed, assuming that the rows of the matrices \(P_i\) are independent realizations of laws which do not give mass to hyperplanes, we show that if \(\sum_i h_i > d\), this reconstruction problem has almost certainly a unique solution. This holds for any number of points in \(\gamma_Z\). A direct consequence of this result is an almost-sure separability property on the empirical Sliced Wasserstein distance.},
