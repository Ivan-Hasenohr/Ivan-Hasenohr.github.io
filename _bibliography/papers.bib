  author={Tanguy, E. and Delon, J. and Flamary, R.},
  abstract={We generalise Wasserstein Barycentres, allowing the computation of barycentres between measures in different spaces. We provide efficient solvers for this new problem, and study a particular case which corresponds to a reconstruction problem. Studying the properties of this problem, we draw partial conclusions on the optima of the discrete Sliced Wasserstein Distance.},
