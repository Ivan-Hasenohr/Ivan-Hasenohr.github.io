I recently defended my PhD titled *Computer-assisted Proofs of Reachability Analysis for Linear Control Systems under Bounded Constraints* at the [MAP5 laboratory](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr), in Université Paris Cité.

My PhD, done under the wonderful supervision of [Camille Pouchol](https://poucholcamille.wixsite.com/perso), [Yannick Privat](https://yannick-privat.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Christophe Zhang](https://christophezhang.netlify.app), was devoted to control theory, more specifically reachability analysis. Using convex analytic tools, numerical analysis and interval arithmetic I have developped computer-assisted proofs of non-reachability for linear control systems, for both ODEs or parabolic PDEs. You can find my thesis [here](https://ivan-hasenohr.github.io/assets/pdf/251120_PhD_thesis.pdf).

In January 2026, I started a postdoctoral researcher part of the [IdCONTROL](https://imsc.uni-graz.at/mr-dynamo/projects/idcontrol) subproject of the [MR-DYNAMO](https://imsc.uni-graz.at/mr-dynamo) Austrian-funded project, working with [Professor Barbara Kaltenbacher](https://me.aau.at/~bkaltenb) at the University of Klagenfurt's [department of mathematics](https://www.aau.at/en/mathematics).
